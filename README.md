How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  How I ensure my code is functional is through white box testing. This tests every scenario that can happen to that specific function.


How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  You must understand the problem they are trying to solve. This can translate directly into functionality even if they are unclear at first.
  
How do I approach designing software?
  Bottom up typically is the approach I go for. Designiing and engineering the lowest level compnents of the requirements and build up from that. This is what works for me.
